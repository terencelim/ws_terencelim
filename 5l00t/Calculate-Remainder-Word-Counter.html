  <h1><a href="https://youaremom.com/play-time/activities-and-games-for-kids/childrens-stories/short-fables/">5 Short
      Fables About Important Values for Children - You are Mom</a></h1>

  <h2>The Milkmaid and Her Pail</h2>
  Words: 101 | Reading Time: 0 Min(s), 25 Sec(s)
  <br>
  <p>
    A girl was going to the market to sell a pail of milk. With the sale’s money, she plans to buy eggs, hatch some
    chickens and then sell them to buy even more animals and gain more money. However, she’s so distracted by her
    thoughts that she trips, the pail falls, and the milk spills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having plans, ideas, and projects is a good thing, but paying attention to what’s ahead is even more. If you don’t
    do the <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/you-dont-know-what-with-your-life-read-this.html">things
      you’re supposed to do now</a>, these projects will be just that: ideas that’ll never get made, without any
    profits to be made.
  </p>

  <h2>The Ant and the Grasshopper</h2>
  Words: 122 | Reading Time: 0 Min(s), 31 Sec(s)
  <br>
  <p>
    This fable tells a similar story to the first one, but from a different point of view. In this case, the grasshopper
    spends its summer singing while the ant keeps working, saving food for winter. Then, what happens when winter comes?
    The grasshopper has nothing to eat and it asks the ant for help, but the ant refuses to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lesson here isn’t about not helping others, but rather avoiding being lazy like the grasshopper. For example, if
    you teach your children to be persistent and help them <a
      href="https://youaremom.com/parenting/create-good-study-habits-children/">create good study habits</a>, they’ll
    focus
    more and it’ll pay off in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, goals aren’t as easy to achieve, so they’ll also develop their sense of responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>The Hare and the Tortoise</h2>
  Words: 94 | Reading Time: 0 Min(s), 24 Sec(s)
  <br>
  <p>
    In a race between these two animals, you can sense who’s going to win. But against all odds, in this fable, the
    tortoise wins. The hare is so sure it’ll win that it evens stops to sleep during the race. However, it sleeps for so
    long that it can’t reach the finish line on time, before the tortoise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looks can be deceiving and <a
      href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201403/the-high-cost-vanity">vanity is an
      enemy</a>. Children shouldn’t compare themselves to their teammates. Winning or losing, having the best grades…
    it’s not what’s truly important. What really matters is the effort one makes.
  </p>

  <h2>The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
  Words: 121 | Reading Time: 0 Min(s), 31 Sec(s)
  <br>
  <p>
    One day, a mouse wakes a huge lion up and asks it to let it live. In return, the mouse will help the lion whenever
    it needs. How could a mouse help a fierce lion? The lion couldn’t answer that either, but it let the mouse go.
  </p>
  <p>
    A while later, some hunters captured the lion, so it roared as loud as it could to ask for help. The mouse heard it
    and it gnawed the ropes to free the lion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The moral of the story is how important it is to <a
      href="https://youaremom.com/parenting/childrens-good-behavior/">treat others well</a> because you never know
    when you might need their help. Helping without expecting something in return is also one of the basic pillars of
    creating strong friendships.
  </p>

  <h2>The Hen that Laid Golden Eggs</h2>
  Words: 99 | Reading Time: 0 Min(s), 25 Sec(s)
  <br>
  <p>
    Try to imagine you have a hen and, from time to time, it lays a golden egg. If this happens, it must be because the
    hen has gold inside, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, this is what the owners of the hen thought, but to their surprise, when they killed it, they found no gold
    inside. Therefore, they were out of golden eggs and the hen.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://youaremom.com/children/teach-children-patience/">Greediness and impatience</a> make us lose our
    way. Sometimes, conforming and taking care of what you have is the best you can do, because you can lose everything
    you have in the blink of an eye.

  <h1>How many words do we read per minute? A review and meta-analysis of reading rate | Marc Brysbaert 2019</h1>
  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For English silent reading it is:
      <ul>
        <li>238 words per minute for non-fiction, and</li>
        <li>260 words per minute for fiction.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>For English reading aloud it is 183 words per minute.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    Based on the analysis of 190 studies (18,573 participants), we estimate that the average silent reading rate for
    adults in English is 238 words per minute (wpm) for non-fiction and 260 wpm for fiction. The difference can be
    predicted by taking into account the length of the words, with longer words in non-fiction than in fiction. The
    estimates are lower than the numbers often cited in scientific and popular writings. The reasons for the
    overestimates are reviewed. The average oral reading rate (based on 77 studies and 5965 participants) is 183 wpm.
    Reading rates are lower for children, old adults, and readers with English as second language. The reading rates are
    in line with maximum listening speed and do not require the assumption of reading-specific language processing.
    Within each group/task there are reliable individual differences, which are not yet fully understood. For silent
    reading of English non-fiction most adults fall in the range of 175–300 wpm; for fiction the range is 200–320 wpm.
    Reading rates in other languages can be predicted reasonably well by taking into account the number of words these
    languages require to convey the same message as in English.

  <h2 id="how-to-calculate-estimated-reading-time">How To Calculate Estimated Reading Time</h2>
  <p>Research varies, but generally, the average adult reads 200-250 words in one minute. </p>
  <p><strong>AvgSlow</strong> : 200 wpm<br><strong>AvgMedium</strong>: 225 wpm<br><strong>AvgFast</strong> : 250 wpm
  </p>
  <p>Convert words into minutes here, some decimals into seconds there, a little rounding at the end… and you can
    calculate estimated time to read manually. </p>
  <p>Here’s how: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find your total word count. Let’s say it’s 938 words. </li>
    <li>Divide your total word count by 200. You’ll get a decimal number, in this case, 4.69. </li>
    <li>The first part of your decimal number is your minute. In this case, it’s 4. </li>
    <li>Take the second part - the decimal points - and multiply that by 0.60. Those are your seconds. Round up or down
      as necessary to get a whole second. In this case, 0.69 x 0.60 = 0.414. We’ll round that to 41 seconds.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The result? 938 words = a 4 minute, 41 second read. </p>
  <p>But that’s really specific. Why not round that time to make things simpler for your reader? Anything less than 30
    seconds gets ignored; anything more than 30 seconds gets rounded up to the next minute. </p>
  <p>Ta-da! That rounding makes your 938-word article a 5-minute read. </p>

  <p>The following advice for preparing and presenting a talk will help you maximize the impact of your talk on an
    audience and ensure that at a minimum they remember the take-away points of your talk. The points apply equally to
    research talks, lectures, and non-technical presentations.</p>
  <h3 id="length-of-presentation">Length of Presentation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The average attention span of an adult is 20 minutes.<ol>
        <li><strong>Implication:</strong> you should ensure that the first 20 minutes of your talk include any material
          that you want your audience to remember.</li>
        <li><strong>Check it out:</strong> The next time you attend a talk look around after 25 minutes and see how many
          people are doing other things, such as doodling, looking at laptops, reading papers, or dozing.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prolonging Attention Span:</strong> You can prolong attention spans by periodically giving your audience
      a rest. This can be done by telling a story, giving a demo, or doing something else that gives the brain a break.
      An analogy to what you are doing is running hard for a few minutes, taking a break, then running hard again.
      However, just as you will typically not be able to run for as long after the break you cannot expect the renewed
      attention span to last as long after the &quot;break&quot;. In fact, count on having only a couple of minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="presentation-content">Presentation Content</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The 4 Golden Questions:</strong> Every research presentation should answer the following four questions:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Where are we now?:</strong> In other words what is the current state of the art before you started
          your research. Answering the question &quot;Where are we now?&quot; will help define for the audience the
          problem your research addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Where are we going?:</strong> The answer to this question tells the audience what you accomplished.
          It should be a high-level, concise description, not a detailed description. Make sure that you answer this
          question in the first couple minutes of your talk. There is an old saying in the newspaper industry that you
          should not bury the headline in the article. The same is true of your talk. Do not bury the main results in
          the middle of the talk. Not only might the audience miss them but you might be past your audience&#39;s 20
          minute attention span and they&#39;ll have already tuned you out.</li>
        <li><strong>How did we get there?:</strong> Now you can get detailed and describe the methods/techniques you
          used or invented to solve your problem.</li>
        <li><strong>What is left for the future?:</strong> At the end of your talk you should clearly state what
          problems are not addressed by your research and are deferred to the future.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>A good talk will provide brief answers to the first three questions in the introduction and then hit the
    &quot;where are we now&quot; and &quot;how did we get there&quot; questions in more detail in the rest of the talk.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>When you change topics, summarize what you have discussed thus far and how that relates to what you are about to
      discuss next. This transition serves three purposes:<ol>
        <li>It provides a &quot;break&quot; for the audience</li>
        <li>It sharpens your presentation by clearly separating topics</li>
        <li>It gives listeners who have tuned you out a chance to get back into the talk.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Introduce concrete examples before formal algorithms: Audiences grasp algorithms much better if you work through
      a concrete example using the algorithm before presenting its formal specification.</li>
    <li>Do a demo before discussing a software system in depth: The same principle that applies to algorithms applies to
      software systems. Listeners will have a much better idea of what you&#39;re talking about if you demo your system
      before explaining implementation decisions.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="presentation-format">Presentation Format</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Fonts</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Font Size</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>For large audiences use a font size of 18 or greater</li>
            <li>For small audiences use a font size of 14 or greater</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Font Family:</strong> Use a sans-serif font like Helvetica. The curls that make serif fonts like
            Times Roman look so nice in printed reports will cause blurring and eye strain when projected to a large
            audience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Font Style/Color</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Use a plain font unless you wish to specifically highlight a point</li>
            <li>Do not use colors to &quot;spice up&quot; your presentation unless you wish to emphasize a point. The
              human eye is naturally drawn to changes in color so color can be useful for emphasizing a point. However
              if you use color indiscriminately then at best you are cluttering your presentation and at worst you are
              wrecking the listener&#39;s concentration.<ol>
                <li>An example of indiscriminate use of color is to color consecutive bullets differently so that your
                  presentation has &quot;variety&quot;.</li>
                <li>An example of the effective use of color is to use one color for the header topic on the slide and a
                  different color for the bullets on the slide. The change of color will highlight the header and draw
                  the listener&#39;s eye to the header, which is the first thing you want the listener to read</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Slides</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The average time spent per slide at talks that I have attended tends to be 1-2 minutes. When preparing a
              talk for a particular duration you can divide the duration by this average to come up with the approximate
              number of slides you should use.</li>
            <li>Limit the number of bullets per slide to five or fewer. There are two reasons for doing so:<ol>
                <li>To reduce the clutter on the slide</li>
                <li>To handle the limitations of short term memory<ol>
                    <li>Most people can hold 5-7 items in short term memory.</li>
                    <li>If you have five bullets on your slide then the majority of your audience can remember the
                      points you&#39;re making without re-reading your slide. If you have more than 5 items per slide
                      than some of your audience will be re-reading your slide and not listening to you, thus missing
                      presumably important information.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Make bullets short and snappy. Do not use complete sentences unless stating a point that requires
                  precision, such as a theorem or definition.<ol>
                    <li>Most people read all the text on a slide before they start paying attention to what you are
                      saying. Hence the more text you have in your bullets the longer it will take for people to start
                      listening to you. If they take too long they might completely lose the thread of thought on that
                      slide which can easily lead to a loss of concentration for your entire talk, especially if you are
                      past the 20 minute threshold.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Color contrasts:</strong> A light font color on a dark background is preferable to a dark font
              color on a light background because the dark background will result in less glare.<ol>
                <li>Yellow or white on a blue or black background tends to work best. Consider using one of yellow/white
                  for the header and the other for the bullets.</li>
                <li>Do not clutter your background with fancy patterns or graphics (e.g., your university&#39;s
                  logo--everyone should know where you are from from your first slide): They will only clutter your
                  slides, distract the listener from the main point of the presentation and, in the case of fancy
                  patterns, possibly even reduce the readability of your text.<ol>
                    <li>it is okay to use subtle background patterns as long as they are unobtrusive.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>When juxtaposing colors, try to use colors from opposite sides of the rainbow. Colors that are close
                  to one another will appear to blur together and provide poor contrast. For example, yellow appears
                  much clearer next to black or blue than it does to green. If you&#39;ve forgotten the rainbow an easy
                  way to remember it is as Roy G. Biv (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>A picture is worth a thousand words:</strong> When possible use pictures to emphasize your
              points rather than text. Pictures can succinctly convey information about processes, algorithms, and
              software interfaces that could take hundreds of words to convey. You will also use words to explain the
              pictures so your verbally oriented listeners can focus on your words while your visually oriented
              listeners can focus on the picture. If you use text only then your visually oriented listeners will be
              disadvantaged.<ol>
                <li>Do not use meaningless pictures (e.g., whimsical pictures) to make your slides more interesting. If
                  you use a picture it should reinforce the point you are making on the slide. Random pictures simply
                  distract your listener and clutter your slide.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Put a header at the top of each slide that succinctly summarizes the topic of that slide.</li>
            <li>Screen snapshots and program listings: Snapshots and listings are next to useless if the listener cannot
              make out the graphics or text.</li>
            <li><strong>Code listings</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Most code listings I see in talks are unreadable. Most presenters seem to recognize this fact
                  because they usually spend only a few seconds on the slide.</li>
                <li>Usually you care about only a few lines of the listing so show only those few lines and either use a
                  bigger font or use a xerox machine or some other tool to increase the font.</li>
                <li>Usually code listings are ineffective because the listener is unfamiliar with the syntax. Hence the
                  listener spends precious time trying to decipher your syntax while not listening to you.</li>
                <li>Bottom line: Unless the code is an integral part of your results skip it in your talk. If you do
                  include it, then be prepared to spend a somewhat significant amount of time on it so that the listener
                  has a chance to understand what you are talking about.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Screen snapshots</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Most screen snapshots I see are unreadable because the fonts are too small.</li>
                <li>Either use a xerox machine or other tool to enlarge the image or edit your code to use bigger fonts
                  before taking the snapshots. As an example, a student of mine needed to display a snapshot of an event
                  recorder. The event recorder displayed a list of events in a 12 point font that was easy on a computer
                  user&#39;s eye but unreadable for an audience. The solution for the talk was to change the font to a
                  much larger point size and take a screen snapshot. The event recorder displayed many fewer events but
                  who cared. The audience members only needed to see one event to get the point.</li>
                <li>Do not let your talk become dominated by screen shots. A live demo with its dynamicism will make
                  your points much more effectively than a series of static snapshots. As with the snapshots, try to
                  enlarge the point sizes in your demo.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Use special effects judiciously: Powerpoint makes it possible to fill your presentation with all sorts
              of &quot;gee whiz&quot; effects. You should resist the temptation to use these effects unless they
              actually enhance your presentation.<ol>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Having bullets &quot;fly in&quot; is an example of a bad use of special
                  effects. Other than distracting your listener and breaking his or her concentration, what purpose does
                  it serve?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Fading in points right before you make them is an example of a bad use of
                  special effects. You can better justify the fading in of bullets because it is less obtrusive then
                  flying them in and because it prevents the listener from reading the bullets before you&#39;re ready
                  to present them. However, if you&#39;ve limited the number of bullets and kept them short and snappy
                  the listener can quickly assimilate the slide and should already be listening to you. Fading in the
                  points will distract the listener and break his or her concentration.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Fading in information to show what happens as an algorithm manipulates a
                  data structure is a good use of special effects. For example, coloring the nodes of a graph as they
                  are reached in depth first search is an excellent way to show how depth first search spreads through a
                  graph. In this case, the ability to present new information while maintaining the same underlying
                  picture maintains the listener&#39;s concentration while moving to another slide will break the
                  listener&#39;s concentration and make it harder for the listener to see what has changed.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="during-the-presentation">During the Presentation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You are your own worst critic: Most people are very self-conscious when they give a talk. Fortunately, your
      audience is usually concentrating so hard on trying to understand what you&#39;re saying that they are not
      noticing the fact that your voice is shaking, that you are backtracking in your sentences, or that you are saying
      &quot;uh&quot; a great deal. Hopefully you can relax a bit if you know that your audience is not hanging on your
      every little imperfection.</li>
    <li>Do not read your slides: Your listeners are perfectly capable of reading and can do it more quickly than you can
      recite them. If you&#39;ve kept your bullets short and snappy you won&#39;t be tempted to recite them because
      there will not be anything to recite. It is okay to periodically recite a point, such as a definition, to drive
      home a point. Just do not make a habit of it.</li>
    <li>Bring a glass of water or some other beverage: Drinking during a talk will lubricate your vocal chords and keep
      you from going hoarse.</li>
    <li>Keep the presentation moving: Do not get side tracked by irrelevant questions. It is okay to tell a listener
      that you will be happy to discuss the question after the talk but that you need to move on.<ol>
        <li>If you are stumped by a question do not try to squirm your way through it. If you&#39;re a good con artist
          you may be able to fake your way through it but you&#39;re normally talking to an educated audience that will
          nail you to the wall. It is much better to move on to firmer footing and minimize the issue than it is to make
          a big deal out of it and firmly implant it in the audience&#39;s mind. For example, if you have not heard of a
          related piece of research just admit it and move on.</li>
        <li>If questions during a talk disrupt your flow it is ok to ask the audience to defer their questions until the
          end of the talk.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Try to keep yourself facing the audience as much as possible. It is not necessary to make eye contact but your
      voice will carry better and you&#39;ll be more likely to use body language that enhances your presentation.</li>
